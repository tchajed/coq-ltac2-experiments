  (* to convert the string to an identifier we have to use the tools from Fresh;

     passing the input string to Ltac2.

    The only FFI from Ltac1 to Ltac2 is to call an Ltac2 expression that solves
    a goal. We'll solve that goal with `fun (x:unit) => x` where the name x is
    the desired identifier - Coq remembers the identifier and we can extract it
    with Ltac1 pattern matching. However, [constr:(fun (x:unit => x))] doesn't work
    because there's no way to inject the Ltac2 identifier --- instead, we
    construct the term manually using Ltac2's Constr.Unsafe. *)

  (* The identity function with a specific name for the bound variable. Strictly
  speaking we could generate (fun (x:unit) => tt), but we really generate the
  identity function so when it's printed the name is shown. (Even though the
  name is printed as _ for unused binders, it's still stored and pattern
  matching can retrieve it). The only downside is that we have to refer to the
  bound variable with an explicit de Bruijn index [Rel 1]. *)

  (* Passing the string into Ltac2 is comparatively easier: we use the ltac2:(x
  |- ...) syntax, which creates an Ltac1 function which takes an argument x and
  passes it to the inner Ltac2 code, which casts it from a dynamically-typed
  Ltac.t to a constr. *)
  Ltac coq_string_to_ident_lambda :=

(* Finally we wrap everything up by running coq_string_to_ident_lambda in a
new context using tactics-in-terms, extracting just the identifier from the
produced lambda, and returning it as an Ltac1 value. *)
